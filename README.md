## A little more about me
I'm a high school student and I'm studying systems development at my own school.
I started studying programming when I was 11 years old, today I'm 15 years old and I have a great passion for technologies and area studies. I have experience in web development, game creation and Android development. I'm always looking to learn new things, my real goal is to be good at what I do and be able to build amazing things with my knowledge
